# v1.1 — LangGraph-Inspired Improvements

**Goal:** Adopt key patterns from LangGraph analysis to harden the orchestrator before scaling.

**Source:** Deep analysis of [langchain-ai/langgraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) — 30 markdown files covering core engine, checkpoint system, prebuilt agents, SDK, CLI, and internals.

**Analysis files:** [`analysis/langgraph/`](https://github.com/pjcau/agent-orchestrator/tree/main/analysis/langgraph)

## Key Findings

| What LangGraph Does Better | What We Do Better |
|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Channel-based state with typed reducers | True provider-agnostic ABC (swap Claude/GPT/Gemini/local) |
| First-class interrupt/resume (HITL) | Cost-aware routing (6 strategies) |
| Content-addressed checkpoint blobs | Agent cooperation protocols (delegation, conflict resolution) |
| 7 stream modes with SSE reconnection | Budget enforcement (per task/session/day) |
| Task-level result caching | Provider health monitoring with auto-failover |
| Conformance test suite for checkpointers | |

## Sprint 1: State & Caching ✅

| Task | Inspired By | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| **Channel-based state with reducers** | [03-channels](https://github.com/pjcau/agent-orchestrator/blob/main/analysis/langgraph/03-channels.md) | ✅ `core/channels.py` |
| **Task-level result caching** | [15-cache](https://github.com/pjcau/agent-orchestrator/blob/main/analysis/langgraph/15-cache.md) | ✅ `core/cache.py` |
| **Conformance test suite** | [16-conformance-tests](https://github.com/pjcau/agent-orchestrator/blob/main/analysis/langgraph/16-conformance-tests.md) | ✅ `core/conformance.py` |

### Channel-Based State

Each state field maps to a typed channel with explicit concurrency semantics:

- `LastValue` — single writer per step (error on conflict)
- `BinaryOperatorAggregate` — fold concurrent writes via reducer (e.g., `operator.add`)
- `Topic` — append all writes (pubsub)

This solves concurrent agent writes to shared state — our current biggest gap.

### Task-Level Caching

Cache skill/node results by input hash. `CachePolicy` per skill. InMemory backend first, Redis later. Skip re-execution on cache hit. Expected to reduce redundant LLM calls by 30%+.

### Conformance Tests

Capability-based test harness for Provider and Checkpoint interfaces. Any new implementation runs against it automatically. LangGraph's suite covers 47+ test cases across 8 capabilities.

## Sprint 2: HITL & Memory ✅

| Task | Inspired By | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| **Interrupt/resume (HITL)** | [19-human-in-the-loop](https://github.com/pjcau/agent-orchestrator/blob/main/analysis/langgraph/19-human-in-the-loop.md) | ✅ `core/graph.py` |
| **Store abstraction** | [14-store](https://github.com/pjcau/agent-orchestrator/blob/main/analysis/langgraph/14-store.md) | ✅ `core/store.py` |
| **Skill middleware pattern** | [18-tool-node](https://github.com/pjcau/agent-orchestrator/blob/main/analysis/langgraph/18-tool-node.md) | ✅ `core/skill.py` |

### Interrupt/Resume

`GraphInterrupt` pauses graph execution, persists state to checkpoint. Resume with `resume_from` checkpoint ID + `human_input` dict merged into state. Interrupt is control flow, not an error.

Supports: `HUMAN_INPUT`, `APPROVAL`, `CUSTOM` interrupt types. Works in both single-node and parallel execution.

### Store (Cross-Agent Memory)

`BaseStore` with namespace-based hierarchy (`("users", "alice")`), `aget/aput/adelete/asearch/alist_namespaces`. Filter operators: `$eq`, `$ne`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`. TTL support with lazy expiration.

`InMemoryStore` implementation with 13 conformance tests. Use cases: user profiles, shared knowledge base, agent learning.

### Skill Middleware

`SkillMiddleware(request, next_fn) -> result` pattern with immutable `SkillRequest` and `override()` for non-destructive modification. Middlewares compose in registration order (first = outermost).

Built-in middlewares: `logging_middleware`, `retry_middleware`, `timeout_middleware`.

## Sprint 3: Persistence & Streaming

| Task | Inspired By | Priority |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Content-addressed checkpoint blobs** | [13-checkpoint-postgres](https://github.com/pjcau/agent-orchestrator/blob/main/analysis/langgraph/13-checkpoint-postgres.md) | Medium |
| **Anti-stall via managed values** | [09-managed-values](https://github.com/pjcau/agent-orchestrator/blob/main/analysis/langgraph/09-managed-values.md) | Medium |
| **Encrypted serialization** | [11-checkpoint-serialization](https://github.com/pjcau/agent-orchestrator/blob/main/analysis/langgraph/11-checkpoint-serialization.md) | Low |
| **SSE streaming improvements** | [27-streaming](https://github.com/pjcau/agent-orchestrator/blob/main/analysis/langgraph/27-streaming.md) | Low |

### Content-Addressed Blobs

Split complex checkpoint values into a `checkpoint_blobs` table keyed by `(thread, ns, channel, version)`. Same blob shared across checkpoints via `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. Massive storage savings for long-running agents.

### Managed Values

Inject `RemainingSteps` / `IsLastStep` into agents as computed, read-only state. Enables graceful degradation instead of hard recursion limit errors.
